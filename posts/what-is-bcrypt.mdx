## What is bcrypt?

bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res, based on the Blowfish cipher. It was introduced in 1999. bcrypt is a key derivation function, which is not suitable for use as a general hash function.


## How do use bcrypt?

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt"
)

func main() {
    password := "password"
    hash, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(password), bcrypt.DefaultCost)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(string(hash))
}
```
